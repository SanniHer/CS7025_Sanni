        <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This collection began in February 2023, shortly after the end of China’s 'epidemic blockade' and following my dissertation on the psychological effects of isolation experienced by astronauts in space. Looking back, much of my work and reflections from that time were shaped by both past and current experiences, such as the negative psychological impacts of isolation, environmental issues, design from a female perspective, and digital interactions with cultural heritage. Human-computer interaction became an ideal platform to explore and express these complex ideas.
            </p>
            <p> Each piece was completed individually and within limited time, and there are areas I haven’t had the chance to delve into further, this portfolio captures my evolving thoughts and creative process. I am also deeply grateful to my advisor, Ao Jiang, whose invaluable guidance was especially helpful during times when I felt creatively stuck.</p>
